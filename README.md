# Green-Care-Assist

Innovative First-Year Hardware Project at the University of Moratuwa: Condition Controlled Ornamental Plant Box.

 I'm excited to announce that my team and have successfully completed our project, " Green Care Assist ", an innovative automated plant care system designed for ornamental plants!

 Our goal was to create a smart, low-maintenance solution that replicates the natural ecosystem of specific plants, making it easy for plant lovers to care for them without the need for extensive knowledge or constant attention.

What We Built: -A fully automated plant box with environmental control features, including temperature, humidity, and soil moisture monitoring. - Integrated Peltier devices for precise temperature control and customized lighting to simulate ideal conditions. -A transparent design that showcases the beauty of the plants, doubling as a decorative piece for indoor spaces. - Notifications and alerts to guide users in adjusting settings when needed.

Project Highlights:
Hands-off plant care: Electri-Green automatically maintains optimal conditions, reducing the time and effort required to grow ornamental plants. Supports rare and exotic plants: Ideal for urban and apartment residents to bring unique plant species into their homes.
- Enhances user well-being with indoor green spaces that improve air quality and reduce stress. stress.
